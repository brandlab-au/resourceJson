# This was the same as json-server repo

## But it now needs to use $resource  
##### See comments in codes push, sorry i ran out of time again. 

- Punam I think best you open old json-server repo and then see what I have done on this project in below list & slow install resource and then build the poject up again to do the same as before but use resource .

- index.html ngResource line 37
- scripts/app.js injected ngResource
- scripts/controllers.js IndexController being used first
- scripts/services.js using $resource


- [ ] index.html not showing anything line 37
- [ ] home.html maybe a problem on attributenames 
- [ ] Maybe services.js 
- [ ] Once again needs to up date db.json form form contact     


## Set up local server with json
- npm install json-server -g
- might be worth putting bower.json into project public
- also might be worth putting intalling grunt
