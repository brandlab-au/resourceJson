##### See comments in codes push 

- Punam could you have a look at this it is the same as the other rep.

- [ ] seems to have a problme using the resource
- <script src="../bower_components/angular-resource/angular-resource.min.js"></script> 
- [ ] Once again needs to up date db.json form form    



## Set up local server with json
