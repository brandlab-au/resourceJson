# This was the same as json-server repo

## But it now needs to use $resource  
##### See comments in codes push, sorry i ran out of time again. 

- Punam I think best open old json and then see what I have done on this and slow install resource again .

- scripts/app.js injected ngResource
- scripts/controllers.js IndexController being used first
- scripts/services.js using $resource


- [ ] index.html not showing anything line 37
- [ ] Was working untill started with bower init
- [ ] Once again needs to up date db.json form form contact     


## Set up local server with json
- npm install json-server -g
